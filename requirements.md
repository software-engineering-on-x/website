# Requirements for our new website

Please follow the style guide of any of these here: https://github.com/software-engineering-on-x/styleguide

Also consider using this in some way: https://github.com/software-engineering-on-x/styleguide/blob/master/paul-volkmer-qVotvbsuM_c-unsplash.jpg

## 1. General

1. The website needs to be compatible with hosting it on GitHub pages.
2. The website should be designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction experience across various devices and screen sizes.
3. The website should be optimized for search engines by implementing proper HTML structure, meta tags, descriptive URLs, and other SEO techniques.
4. The website should have a light mode and a dark mode option that automatically detects the system settings and it should include a button to toggle as well.
5. The website must be hosted on your GitHub Pages so we can view it without clone it and running it locally.

## 2. Navbar

1. The website should have a navbar.
2. The navbar should contain a logo on the top left.
3. The navbar should have links to the community, the github organization and contact page.
4. The navbar should follow when you scroll.

## 3. Body

1. The website should have a space for content in the body.
2. The body should include two banner texts similar to what Vercel has here: https://vercel.com/about. You could make up any cool text based on the community and what its about.
3. The body should have two sections, first section should be "Community Moderators", the second one "Community Partners".
4. In the section "Community Moderators" a picture, link to account and the display name of the moderator should appear. (Take inspiration from https://vercel.com/about under "Individual investors" section.). It should be a grid of 3 columns.
5. In the section "Community Partners" a picture, link to account and the display name of the partner should appear. (Take inspiration from https://vercel.com/about under "Individual investors" section.). It should be a grid of 3 columns.

Note: To find the Software Engineering partners, send DM to me @mjovanc on X.

## 4. Footer

1. The website should have a footer.
2. The footer should contain the logo and logo to X and GitHub which points to our X community and the GitHub Organization.
3. The footer should have a (or more) button(s) that allows the users to switch to light/dark/system mode.

This is pretty much it, for the rest you have freedom to come up with more things if you wish so.
